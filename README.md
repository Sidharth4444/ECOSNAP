# ECOSNAP
A fun eco game aiming sustainability through entertaining interactions .
ECOSNAP was built at the "Hack for Impact:Innovate for a better tomorrow" hackathon organised by IEEE IA/IE/PELS Jt. Chapter,Kerala.
After a round of online scrutinizing,the Event was held at College of Engineering,Attingal by the participation of selected teams including ours.
ECOSNAP asks users to capture their dailylife activities which are sustainable and engage them in a gaming environment.
The idea is to build a gaming system by rewarding users for their sustainable activities by using leaderboards and milestone rewards.
Users have to upload the photos of their activity which ECOSNAP monitors and gives points.
